PremierLeague
=============

I'm using this project to see how various Windows 8 app features can be implemented.

The app shows the English football league Premier League teams grouped according to their current position in the league table when compared to what was predicted before the season started by the FourFourTwo magazine (http://fourfourtwo.com/). The focus is on building a well-behaving Windows 8 app that supports as many useful contracts as makes sense; the actual app is not very useful at least for now.
